# Water-Leakage-Detection
## Introduction
I am Aditya Karmakar from class 6.

## Components
Arduino Nano BLE 33,
Edge Impulse,
Arduino Softwarem,
Connector,
Tap.

## Background Story
Water is an indidpensibl source of life.Our planet Earth gets its name as Blue planet due to this exclusive feature.

It is good to be aware of the fact that though a large part of our planet is covered with water,but only a small
bit of it is available for consumption.
Increasing population and acceterating population is already 
posing a threat on this life saving resource.
A lot many cases of leakages go undetected and unresolved.
I have observed it in my house and neighbour.

 ##  Work
     Concept of this project.
     Many a times I have seen that in hurry people leave the tap open.
     I have made a dector which will tell if the tap is open or close.
     

## My Solution
Using Technology and making it handy for each family,I want to make water-leakage-detector.
Using Arduino Nano BLE 33,Edge Impulse and Arduino Software.
